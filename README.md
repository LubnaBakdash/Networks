Network Project: IP Subnetting and Routing Configuration
This project focuses on subnetting and routing configurations within a local area network (LAN). The objective is to demonstrate various network operations, such as subnetting, determining network and broadcast addresses, and routing using the RIP v2 protocol. Additionally, the project uses Tracer Packet to build the network and assigns IP addresses to network devices such as PCs and switches.

Project Overview
The network topology includes a LAN connected to a router (DC). The network configuration includes determining network masks, network addresses, and broadcast addresses. It involves subnetting the network and calculating subnets based on IP class and network requirements. The RIP v2 protocol is used for routing to enable efficient data delivery across the network. Tracer Packet is used to visually build and simulate the network structure.

Key Features
Subnetting based on network requirements.
Calculation of network, broadcast, and gateway addresses.
Use of RIP v2 protocol for routing.
IP address allocation for devices in different subnets.
Visual network building and testing using Tracer Packet.
Network Design and Configuration
IP Subnetting and Addressing
The project begins by defining an initial network address, then subnetting it into smaller subnets based on the needs of the network. The network mask, network address, and broadcast address for each subnet are calculated, ensuring that IP addresses are efficiently distributed across devices.

Subnet Calculation
Subnetting involves dividing the initial network into smaller subnets to allocate IP addresses for various devices or segments of the network. For each subnet, the first and last host IP addresses are calculated along with the broadcast address.

Network Summarization
Network summarization is applied to optimize routing. This involves consolidating smaller subnets into a larger network address range to reduce the number of routes that the router needs to maintain.

Routing Configuration (RIP v2)
The RIP v2 routing protocol is configured to enable dynamic routing between subnets, ensuring efficient routing of data packets. The router is set up to advertise network information to other routers, making it easier to manage large networks.

Network Construction with Tracer Packet
Using Tracer Packet, the network structure is visually created by connecting switches and PCs to the router. This tool helps simulate packet transmission, making it easy to verify the proper routing and overall network connectivity.

Device Configuration
Devices such as PCs are assigned IP addresses and configured with the appropriate subnet masks and default gateways. Switches are configured to handle Layer 2 traffic and ensure correct connectivity between devices.

Network Testing
Once the network is built and configured, various network tests are performed using ping and traceroute commands. These tools help ensure that all devices can communicate across different subnets and that routing is functioning correctly.

Technologies Used
Subnetting: To divide the network into manageable subnets.
RIP v2: For dynamic routing between subnets and efficient data forwarding.
Tracer Packet: To simulate and visualize the network.
IP Addressing: To allocate unique IP addresses to each device in the network.
How to Run the Project
Set up a router, switches, and PCs using Tracer Packet.
Assign the appropriate IP addresses and subnet masks to each device.
Configure RIP v2 routing on the router.
Test connectivity by running ping and traceroute commands.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of subnetting, network summarization, and routing in a local area network. By using RIP v2 for routing and Tracer Packet for network visualization and testing, we ensure efficient communication across different subnets and successful data packet routing.
